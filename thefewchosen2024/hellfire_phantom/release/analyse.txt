p = 1154543773027194978300531105544404721440832315984713424625039
p is a prime

online factoring gets us the prime factorisation of phi(p) = p-1:
2 × 641 × 900580166167858797426311314777226771794720995307888786759

this could help us in finding the discrete logarithm of 2^secret

Quite easily from the point we are given, we also find curve_b = 85127
