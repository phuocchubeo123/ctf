chocolate_generator:
13^m + 37^m mod p

This is a linearly recurrent sequence. The recursion equation is:
a_{n+2} = 50 a_{n+1} - 481 a_{n}


chocolate_bag contains:
a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{golden-ticket - 2}, a_{golden-ticket - 1}, a_{golden-ticket}

To get a_{golden-ticket} is easy.
However, we want to get golden-ticket, a.k.a the discrete log.

Or not? Maybe we can get something better, like Euclidean algorithm?
