I am learning a bit about integral closure. 

*Definition 1.* Let $A$ be a subring of $B$. An element $u \in B$ is integral over $A$ if there exists a monic polynomial $f$ in $A[X]$ such that $f(u) = 0$.

*Lemma 1.* Let $A$ be a subring of $B$. An element $u \in B$ is integral over $A$ if and only if $B$ contains an $A[u]$-module that contains $1$ and is finitely generated as an $A$-module.
